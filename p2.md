# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

In total, our group has had two brainstorming sessions: one in tutorial, and the other was during a scheduled meeting outside of class.  During these sessions, we tried to come up with ideas that we thought would benefit our target users: whether that be representative of the entire system, or just segments - smaller functions of the system.  These sessions were carried out as such: with a pen or pencil, sketch out an idea on a piece of paper (one idea per piece of paper) and then discuss them at the end of the session.  From our sessions, we have collectively come up with around 20 different ideas, although a lot of them are smaller functions rather than ideas about the entirety of the system.  None of the ideas that we came up with were extremely outrageous either, and I think that's due to the fact that, as computer science students, we are used to coming up with solutions that, logically, gets the job done, and not necessarily in the most unique of ways. (Also, there is probably not a single creative chromosome in any of our DNA make-up.)  So, trying to come up with creative ideas proved to be rather difficult for our group.

These ideas were separated and grouped with others that were similar.  In total, we came up with four different categories: Scheduling, Graphical, Identification, and Selection.  A lot of our ideas, however, were based on the idea of scheduling an attraction.  I think because that because this is the most important functionality of our application, we came up with the most ideas for it.  Collectively, we have come up with 12 different ideas for the scheduling function of the system.  These ideas ranged from single attraction scheduling to scheduling an entire days worth of attractions at once.  Also, there were some ideas that focused on some of the smaller details of scheduling, such as sorting, displaying, drag and drop or simply clicking.

The other three categories did not have as much variety as the scheduling one, but the ideas were very definitive in what it was trying to do.  Depicted in the first picture below is the graphical ideas that we came up with.  These ideas represent the main UI for the application, or the interface that the user sees the most.  Due to this fact, the ideas that were come up with ended up being some sort of graphic since people do usually enjoy looking at graphics over text.

The next group of ideas that we have is the selection ideas, and this is similar to the scheduling group but it was different enough that we thought it deserved its own group.  This group of ideas is not about the scheduling process, but more so of the displaying of information about the rides or attractions themselves.  

The last group of ideas are of user identification - how the theme park will be able to determine the differences between fast pass users.

![](http://i.imgur.com/p3s12np.jpg?1 "Identification Ideas")

The below three pictures are the three ideas that we all decided were the best out of the entire lot.  None of them are ideas for the entire system, but they are ideas for critical components to the functionality of our application.

The first idea that we decided on was from our graphical ideas.  We decided on this graphical interface due to some of the facts we have found out through our secondary research: people who go to theme parks are usually looking at everything that surrounds them, deciding on what ride they want to go on next, or what attraction they want to go see.  Because of this fact, we decided that a UI that capitalizes on this detail would be the most beneficial to the users.  They will be able to see all the information about the rides and attractions that surrounds them on a single interface, without having to go to the location to ask or see for themselves.  So, this idea is based on this and will use their location to display all the attractions that surround them.  By clicking on an attraction, they are able to view more details about the attraction, such as the schedule for the attraction, or the history behind it.

The second idea we decided on was a scheduling idea, which is something that is essential for the functionality of the application.  Without the ability to schedule times for an attraction, they whole idea of our fast pass is completely useless.  So, we decided on a UI in where the user is able to see the entire day schedule for an attraction, at once.  This means that they are able to see all the time slots that are available for scheduling, as well as all the time slots that are already allotted to other people.  By displaying all this information to the user, they are easily able to see which times are available and which times are not, making their scheduling experience easier, and thus, giving them a much more enjoyable experience at the theme park.

The last idea that we decided on is from the identification group - a method of distinguishing the difference between other fast pass users, or something that makes each fast pass user unique.  We decided on the use of a QR code in accomplishing this.  By using this QR code, each user is different, so they can use this QR to verify their identity when they are "checking in" for their scheduled attractions, or rides.

## Storyboard

When developing our storyboard, we wanted to focus on a single idea.  However, with the way that we came up with our ideas, it was not possible to create an effective storyboard without incorporating other ideas.  Our ideas were more so like functions rather than systems, so in order create a storyboard that makes sense, we combined some ideas together.  

The task that we based our storyboard on is the second task from our task list: Karen and her husband attend a theme park with their children, and their children are antsy to engage in some rides and attractions, so Karen needs to schedule a ride so that her entire family will be able to enjoy the theme park together.  We selected this task because we felt that it was a task that would be able to show most of the functions that are available within the appliation of the fast pass.  With that being said, we didn't want the storyboard to only represent the completion of the task, but also the completion of many other tasks.

Our storyboard shows the main functions of our application: the main UI, the scheduling, and the user identification.

The first picture is the main UI.  The user will see this screen the most as it is the screen that displays the most information, as well as the screen used to navigate to other functions of the application.  The rides and attractions that are visible on the screen are those that are near the user at the moment.  By tapping on an attraction, it will display more information about that specific attraction.  Also, the user is able to access other menus through this screen, such as a menu that lists all the rides at the theme park, as well as a user schedule.

The second picture is a list of all the rides and attractions on location at the theme park.  This menu can be reached by tapping on the globe icon that is located on the main UI.  From this menu, the user is able to view and book a time slot at a ride or attraction, pending on other parameters, such as available time slots, age restrictions, height requirements, etc.

The third picture is a menu that can be reached by clicking on a single ride from the ride list menu.  The intent of this menu is to display more detailed information about a single ride, such as a description, requirements to ride or attend it, and a schedule where the user is able to see all the time slots that are available, as well as the time slots that are already booked.

The fourth picture depicts what happens after a user books at least one time slot at an attraction.  There is a widget, or a notification bar, that displays the users next, or upcoming, attraction or ride that they have scheduled.  With this, the user can easily see what they have coming up without directly looking at their schedule.

The fifth picture is of the user's schedule, and it may be reached by swiping up on the main UI.  From here, the user can view all the rides and attractions that they have booked time slots on in a time line.  

The sixth and last picture is a QR code.  To get to this menu, all the user has to do is swipe right once from their schedule.  This QR code is used to distinguish the difference between fast pass users.  When it is time for the user to go to their scheduled attraction, they can pull up this QR code and the employee may let them through by just scanning the code.  

## Video Prototype

For our video prototype, which is based on our storyboard, we run through the task of scheduling a time slot at a Carousel ride, and later, pulling up the QR code in order to scan ourselves into the ride.

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

The task that we'll do a walkthrough for is the same task that we've selected for the storyboard, as well as the video prototype: Task 2 from our list of tasks, where Karen has to schedule a ride for her entire family due to her overexuberant children.  

Task Step | Knowledgeable? | Motivated? | Believeable? | Comments/Solutions
--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | ---
1. Open the application | Maybe | Yes | Yes | Unless the user is completely unaware of the functions that the fast pass is able to accomplish, this shouldn't really be a problem.  <br/> We expect that when the user purchases the fast pass, they are briefed on what it can be used for, and how it may be used.
2. Tap the list icon | No | Yes | Yes | The list icon may not be extremely clear as to what it does.  <br/> To fix this, we can change the icon from a list to something like a rollercoaster, so that it is clear that the rides and attractions can be accessed by clicking on it.
3. Tap filter dropdown | Yes | Yes | Yes |
4. Select Family in dropdown | Yes | Yes | Yes | 
5. Click on a ride | No | Yes | Yes | It is not made clear that the entire bar that contains the information of the ride is clickable.  <br/> To remedy this, we can add a button at the end of the bar, or some other form of indicator that it can be selected.
6. Select an open time slot | Yes | Yes | Yes |
7. Click Yes to confirm booking | Yes | Yes | Yes |
8. Tap ME button for user info | Yes | Yes | Yes |
9. Swipe right for QR code | Maybe | Yes | Yes | It may not be intuitive for Karen to swipe right to find a QR code herself.  <br/> This knowledge, of course, could be explained to her when she enters the park, or by an employee who works at a ride or attraction.  <br/> A possible solution to this problem is that we could remove the swiping action all together from the application and just replace it buttons, or icons, that represent each individual function.  So, a single button that will take the user to the QR code, and a different button that will display the schedule.  The intuition for putting those two functions together in the first place is that they're both something that is important to the user.

This task is an end-to-end job she is able to complete what she sets out to do from the beginning, and that is enjoy something together with the entirety of her family.  Through the application, she is able to schedule a ride that is suitable for people of all ages, and in the end, get her family into the ride by scanning her QR code, which is representative of her family.

## Reflection

The creative thinking part was something that was definitely challenging for us, as a group.  If we were to do it over again, we would definitely try something different.  Some creative motivation is definitely needed for our group as we struggled to come up with any creative ideas, and this limits the variety in the ideas that we can come up with.  This makes the construction of the affinity diagram relatively easy as there probably should have been more parity in the number of ideas per grouping.  However, we don't think that the ideas we eventually decided on are bad by any means.  They're ideas that are intuitive and are indicative of how clear the information is communicated.  

Everything else during the ideation process went rather smoothly.  We were able to come up with our storyboard quite quickly once we had settled on an idea.  We were able to split up the workload amongst our group quite well when creating the video prototype, with each working on separate "pages" or "slides".  We didn't run into any issues with the task-centered system walkthrough, although we were unsure as to how much detail we were suppose to provide for it to be sufficient.
