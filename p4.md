# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

Over the course of a little bit over a month, our team was able to effectively gather information about the users’ needs and wants, come up with multiple ideas for a product we can distribute to the user base, and create a functioning prototype in which we can use.  Below details the steps and procedures that we took in order to get to the stage we are at, right now.  

## Introduction

When our team was deciding on which idea we should go for, or which design problem we should try to solve, we wanted to choose something that would have a relatively large impact – something that would prove to be useful to many people who will use it.  So, we ended up selecting a theme park as our target topic, since many people do go to theme parks to enjoy themselves, and the people who attend are extremely varied, from children to adults to the elderly.  We asked each other, as well as ourselves, “How can we make someone’s theme park experience better? What do we love about theme parks? What do we hate?”  These are the kind of questions that we asked in order to find the main problem we wanted to tackle.  

## Design Problem

After discussing what problems we could potentially tackle, we landed on the idea of waiting times and queuing.  At theme parks, queuing for a certain ride or attraction is common practice, and we spend a lot of our times just standing in line.

After some research, we found out that some theme parks have invented a system called a “Fast Pass System”, where the customers are allowed to skip the line and go directly onto the ride or attraction for a premium price.  In most cases, it is a one time transaction for a days worth of rides.  So, we decided that this was something that we could focus on – how can we improve this current system?  What are the problems that occur with this system?  These are the questions that we ask ourselves prior to doing any user research.

## User Research and Findings

Before doing any of our user research, we identified potential users and stakeholders, who will be affected by the fast pass system?  We came up with three main groups:

* __Management__ - the distributors of the system
* __Employees__ - the people who will manage the system
* __Customers who use the fast pass system__ - the direct users of the system
* __Customers who do not use the system__ - fast pass users will bypass them in the queue

For our user research, we use three main methods:

* __Interview__
  * We selected this method because we believe that user accounts are the most effective and useful in obtaining information about the topic at hand, because we can get their first-hand experience.  This way, we can easily extract what the user likes/dislikes about the system.
  * The questions we came up with to ask the interviewee are:
	* What do you think about the fast-pass system?
	* How does the fast-pass system affect your theme park experience?
	* What are some of the drawbacks?
	* What other functions could be added that would benefit you?
	* Which demographic do you think the fast-pass is most beneficial for?
  * We interviewed someone who has been to Disneyland and directly use their own implementation of the fast pass system.  From the information we have gathered from the interview, the main points we could take away from them are:
	* a method of viewing the wait times for rides or attractions
	* a map
	* more information about specific rides and attractions
* __Survey__
  * We selected this method specifically because of the fact that we can reach a large amount of people with ease.
  * For this method, we used the same questions that we came up from the Interview, and the main results were:
	* a way of viewing the most/least busy rides/attractions
	* wait times for rides and attractions
	* favourites so they are easier to access
* __Secondary Research__
  * We selected this method to find out more about the user experience at theme parks that have implemented a similar system to the fast-pass system.  This is useful information because it is information that the user spends time to articulate and divulge onto the internet to help others make their own choices on the fast-pass system.  From this, we found that:
	* people would prefer scheduling instead of priority queue -> on busy days, priority queue still gets long, which results in two long lines instead of just one -> sort of defeats the purpose of paying a premium price to skip the line
	* system detracts from the experience of non-fast pass users

## Design and Justification

With all the information we gathered from our user research, we had brainstorming sessions to come up with ideas and designs for a better, improved system.  We then compiled these ideas into an affinity diagram (see below) and sorted the ideas into categories.

We categorized our ideas in terms of function – how something works within the system.  From this, we extracted three main functions for the system: 

* Scheduling rides instead of a priority queue
	* We chose this as a main design idea because, from our secondary search, we found that even though people are able to skip queues and go directly onto the ride or attraction simply by checking in at the specific ride or attraction, if there are a lot of people, it still creates a queue.  So, in reality, instead of shortening a single line, it splits it into two.  In turn, this makes both lines go slow because now the employee has to manage two lines, instead of just a single one.
	* The way this will work is that each ride and attraction will have its own schedule, and people will be able to book "time slots" for a certain amount of people.  The schedule will display all the available times for that specific day, and this will make it easy for the user to see all the time slots.  If the time slot is occupied, then it may be shown by being greyed out.
* A realistic view of the park as the main page
	* This selection was also influenced by some of our secondary research: we found that when people go to the theme park, they tend to look for the things that surround them, so by choosing this design we are capitalizing on these human tendencies.
	* This view will actually be the main page of the system, where the user can see a virtual realization of their current surroundings based on their GPS location.  Through this view, the user can tap/click on rides and attractions that are "in view", and see more information about that specific ride or attraction, as well as schedule a time slot for it, if they so choose.
* A list view of all the rides/attractions
	* This design was chosen as a way to easily show the user all of the rides and attractions that are on the theme park site.  
	* The user will be able to filter for certain rides by category to fill their needs, or search for something specific, if they know the name of the ride or attraction.  Also, they will be able to schedule a time slot from this page as well by simply clicking/tapping on the ride.

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

From our heuristic evaluation, we found that one of our main functions, which is scheduling for a ride or attraction, is not really “complete”.  This means that there is some functionality missing that should probably be there for it to be complete.  We have found that once the user has scheduled their time slot for a ride, there is no way for the user to “unschedule” that ride.  This is an important function because, as we know, people in general are prone to making mistakes.  If this function is not included then we are limiting the user’s control of the system, and not giving them the option to correct their mistakes, and this violates the “user control and freedom” heuristic.

Also, we found that when the user schedules, it schedules for their entire party, and there is no way for the user to schedule for an individual within the party.  For example, if I am in a party of 4, and I am the only one who wants to go on the Carousel (because I am a thrill seeker), I should be able to do that.  This violates the visibility of system status heuristic, since we are not giving them the option to do anything with this information.

We gave both of the above violations the a severity rating of 4, which means that the problem must be fixed before official release, and it is of extremely high importance that we do fix it.  This is because we believe that these two functions are essential in making the user experience much better by giving the user all the options available when scheduling for a ride or attraction.

We also found some inconsistency issues with our system, namely, the party function.  Below are two animated .gif images – the image on the left is the “Create Party Page” and the one on the right is the “Edit Party Page”.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGctSYkuhSPqRLYA/giphy.gif "Adding a member to the party")

With the Create Party Page, the user must select the number of party members before moving to another page to enter the user information, where as for the Edit Party Page, everything is contained on one page, and the user is able to add a user by interaction with the “+” button, and removing a user by interaction with the “-“ button.  These two pages produce the same results in the end, but they function just slightly differently, thus, it violates the “consistency and standards” heuristic.  We gave this violation a severity rating of 2, since we thought that it wasn’t really that big of a deal that they work slightly differently, but it would be nice just to keep things consistent.

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

Of course, for the next iteration of our prototype, we want to fix the issues that were found above.  This means that we need to:

* add the ability to unschedule a ride - go to personal schedule and remove it from there.  This should free up the slot that was otherwise previously occupied
* add the ability to select specific individuals from the party and schedule them for a ride or attraction
* use the party information to compare with ride regulations to make the ride selection process easier. e.g. filter for rides only the entire party can go on (based on height, weight, etc)
* use just one of the party pages to keep it consistent - probably better to use the edit party page since we don't need to jump between pages, and can edit everything within a single page

## Conclusions

We made a lot of progress within a short amoug of time for this project - we were able to complete the main functions for the system and have a working prototype up and running.  In the next iterations, we plan on ironing out some issues, as well as fully implementing some functions that were missing that we felt weren't as important as the ones that we have implemented up until this point.  We hope that, at the end of this journey, we will be able to release a product that will benefit many people, and improve their experiences at the theme park.
