## Highlight Walkthrough

For our prototype, we have identified and worked on accomplishing three main functionalities: the ability to create and edit a party, to schedule a ride or attraction, and to view your own personal schedule.

The first main function is the creation of a party, and this allows the user to schedule times on rides and attractions with a group of people, whether it be their family or friends.  In order to access this page, however, the user needs an access code.  After the code has been accepted, the user is taken to a page where they will be able to select a party size from 1 to 6, and this is manipulable through the arrows, which are made large to be easily distinguishable.  Clicking on the continue button located at the bottom will progress the user to the next page where they will be able to enter all the required information that the system needs to identify each unique user.  Each field has a hint in it to let the user know what type of information is needed in which field.  If the user decides to create the party without all the required information, red boxes that surround the empty fields are shown to let the user know that those fields still need their input (however this can be improved since it may not be entirely intuitive to the user; a dialog box detailing what needs to be done would help in this regard).  Once the party is created, the user is taken to the main page.

Also, the user is given the option to edit their party after the fact, in case that they need to make adjustments, additions or subtractions to their party, or just need to update their information.  This can be accessed through the main page by clicking on the "edit party" button, located at the bottom left.  This takes the user to the page where they can see the entire party and all the associated information.  Clicking on the edit button will allow the user to edit the information, turning all the text into text boxes.  
From here, the user has a few options:

* _They can edit all existing information by simply modifying the text that is contained in the text boxes_
* _They can add a party member by clicking on the green "+", and entering in the required information_
* _They can remove a party member by clicking on the red "x" located above each member icon, which will bring up a dialog box confirming if the option they selected is truly their intended action_

The next function is the most important one, and that is scheduling a time slot for a ride or attraction, and this can be accomplished in one of two ways.

The first way is through the ride list, which is a list that contains all the rides and attractions that are on site for the theme park.  This can be accessed through the main page by clicking on the "ride list" button, located at the bottom right of the screen.  On this page, the user can view all of the rides and attractions, and can search for something specific through the search bar, or filter the list through multiple categories.  They can click on a specific ride and this will take the user to a page for that specific ride with its own schedule.  This schedule is sorted by time (hour), and clicking on a time will display the time slots for that time.  Time slots that are blacked out represents time slots that somebody else has already allocated, which means that time slot cannot be booked anymore.  So, the user will have to look for a time slot that is open and suitable for them, and to make this easier, for each hour, the amount of slots that are open, or available, is displayed.  Clicking on one of the open time slots will bring up a dialog box which asks the user to confirm the scheduling, and clicking on "Yes" will officially schedule that time slot for the user.  From here, the user is brought back to the main menu, and a notification is displayed at the top of the page, indicated the user's next scheduled ride.

The other way to schedule a ride is through the interactive main menu.  With a GPS connection, the main menu displays the rides and attractions that are located around the user.  These rides and attractions may be clicked on, and doing so will display a message box that contains how many slots are available for that specific ride, as well as a button that will take the user to the schedule should they choose to do so.  From there, the scheduling process is done in the same fashion as the first method.

The last piece of functionality that we've implemented for our prototype is the ability to view their personal schedule.  With this, the user is able to view all of their scheduled rides and attractions all at once.  This page can be accessed through the main page, which is the middle button that is located at the bottom of the screen, titled "My Information".  The red line in the schedule is used to easily indicate what the current time is, and can be used as a reference to see how far or close they are to their next scheduled ride or attraction.  The scheduled rides are contained in their own boxes next to their own scheduled times.

From the scheduled page, the user may also access the check-in page, which the user can use to check-in to the ride or attraction that they have upcoming.  All they have to do is flash the QR code that is contained within the page to the employee who works at that specific site.

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

Individually, our group members did their own heuristic evaluations, and later combined our results through discussions and comparisions.  Through these results, we've come up with two problems that warranted a severity rating of 4 (the highest), meaning that our next iteration of the prototype, we _MUST_ fix these select issues.  

The first problem is that we have no way to "unschedule" a ride after we schedule it.  The user may schedule a ride accidentily, or has to leave early and wants to undo all their scheduled rides, but cannot.  This is a major one because it allows the user more control over the system, and if they made a mistake, there is no way of correcting it, and this, we gave this problem a severity rating of 4.  This problem violates the _"user control and freedom"_ heuristic, and in the next iteration, it is definitely the one we will focus on, the most.  An obvious solution to this problem is to implement a way to remove the scheduled time slot, most easily done through their own personal schedule.

The other problem that we gave a severity rating of 4 is that there is no way to schedule specific people of the user's party for certain rides.  Of course, there will be limitations and restrictions on certain rides, and without this function, it does not have these restrictions.  This means that children or younger kids who must meet a certain requirement in order to enter the ride or attraction does not have to go through this check.  This problem also violates the _"user control & freedom"_ heuristic, and a solution for this problem is to implement a method where we can select specific members of the party when scheduling.  Also, we can implement some sort of check with the party member information (age, height) in order to make sure that they are eligible for certain rides and attractions.

Some other problems that are not as severe as the above, but do require some attention are:

* Through the main page, when trying to schedule for a ride, the rides or attractions that are clickable should be highlighted to easily indicate that they're interactive objects, but it is not made obvious enough through our current implementation.  This violates the _"minimalist design"_ heuristic and an easy solution is to make the highlight around the object more visible.  In the end, we gave this problem a severity rating of 3.
* There is no way to view more specific information about a ride or attraction, more specifically, the limitations and restrictions that the ride or attraction has.  Having this information would prove to be valuable since the user is able to see what ride or attraction is suitable for them, or their family.  This problem violates the _"recognition rather than recall"_ heuristic, since some specific information is displayed on the ride list page, but that all disappears when the user goes to actually schedule the ride.  A solution to this problem is to create a page where this information is easily accessible, or add it to the current ride scheduling page.  Thus, we gave this problem a severity rating of 3.
