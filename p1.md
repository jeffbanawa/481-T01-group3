# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

The idea we have come up with for our project is to create an application that makes the Fast-Pass systems that some theme parks have implemented more efficient, as well as more accessible.  With the goal to improve efficiency, we hope that the users make the most of their experience at the theme park, and inspire others who may not otherwise choose to purchase a fast-pass, consider it.

We expect that our users will use this application during their visit to a theme park, to view the attractions available, as well as schedule a visit to an attraction, skipping the need to queue up.  By doing this, they are saving time wasted standing in a line, and may use their time to do other activities in the theme park, such as eating or visiting other attractions.

The pass can used for an individual, or a group of people.  Individuals will easily be able to schedule themselves for an attraction or a ride because a single slot is easily fillable.  As a group, it may be more difficult to queue up for an attraction due to the fact that there are more people to account for, but it makes it easy to queue up together.


## Stakeholders and Users

Our expected users are common theme park go-ers, whether they are families, thrill seekers, young adults, students, or general youth.  With these users, they are expected to have access to a cellphone, or another means of accessing the application.  With this expectation, they are also expected to have at least some sort of knowledge of how to operate an electronic device.  Navigation through the application won’t be difficult, but people without prior experience with such technology will struggle with the use of the device.  With this basic knowledge, the user should easily be able to schedule their times at their desired attractions.

The list below depicts our expected shareholders - the people who are affected by the system in one way or another, but are not necessarily users of the system:

* __Management__ - the main distributor of the system, so they are impacted directly by how well the system is doing
* __Employees__ - mainly affects the employees who work at an attraction - they need to have access to the system in order to properly check who is scheduled their time for an attraction.  Also affects the people who deal with admissions, since they are they ones who distribute the fast-passes
* __Customers__ - regular customers who don’t have a fast-pass aren’t directly interacting with the system, but they’ll be affected in the sense that fast-pass holders will be bypassing them while they wait in a queue

## User Research Methods

The three research methods that we chose for our project are:

* __Interview__
  * We selected this method because we believe that user accounts are the most effective and useful in obtaining information about fast-passes, because we can get their first-hand experience.  This way, we can easily extract what the user likes/dislikes about the system.
* __Survey__
  * We selected this method specifically because of the fact that we can reach a large amount of people with ease.
* __Secondary Research__
  * We selected this method to find out more about the user experience at theme parks that have implemented a similar system to the fast-pass system.  This is useful information because it is information that the user spends time to articulate and divulge onto the internet to help others make their own choices on the fast-pass system.

### User Research Method 1: Interview
![](http://i.imgur.com/obZhbJT.jpg/ "Interview")

The way we went about it is this: we each tried to find someone that has previously bought a fast-pass for a theme park, asking friends, relatives and family.  Given the limited time that we have, it would be difficult to go to a theme park, especially one that has a fast-pass system implemented, so we settled for one interviewee who recently went to Disneyland in April, 2017.  This interview took place in a quiet section of the Computer Science Laboratory.

The questions we asked, as well as the responses from the interviewee, can be found below:

* Some background information of the interviewee:
  * 21 years old
  * Went to Disneyland in California, USA
  * Likes to go on an adventure, tries to maximize the value of the stay by spending as much time as possible at the park and tries to go to all of the attractions
* What do you think about the fast-pass system?
  * Feels that it will be “worth it” if the normal queues are long
* How does the fast-pass system affect your theme park experience?
  * Liked that you can get priority for attractions, resulting in shorter wait time, and is especially useful when the weather is hot and humid
* What are some of the drawbacks?
  * Not always useful
    * Pointless if line-ups are not long
* What other functions could be added that would benefit you?
  * Wait time for the rides
  * Map of the park
  * Information about the ride
  * Free express pass
  * Limited time - have to line up to get another one
* Which demographic do you think the fast-pass is most beneficial for?
  * Youth, teenagers, families and ride enthusiasts


### User Research Method 2: Survey

![](http://i.imgur.com/WhXp4mg.png/ "Survey")

In order to conduct the survey, we used SurveyMonkey to create a survey of the 5 questions that we made in the tutorial. The survey was deployed by sharing a link on social media and we received 7 responses.

Many of the takers of the survey said that the passes are expensive, but can see the merit in buying it for those who can afford to.  The pass can be beneficial for families, people with children, disabled or elderly people who cannot stand in line for an extended period of time.  Also, some feel that it magnifies the class difference between the people who uses the pass vs. those who don’t.  People who stand in the regular queue find it annoying that others can bypass them in the queue with more money, and even then it still creates another queue, so they will still have to wait.

* Recommended features of the system: 
  * Some sort of loyalty system where they can get the pass for free
  * Notifications for which rides are most/least busy, popular
  * Wait times for attractions
  * The ability to favourite attractions for easier access
  * Coupons or deals for future fast-pass opportunities
  * Instead of a fast-pass, everyone has the ability to schedule their time at an attraction


### User Research Method 3: Secondary Research

In execution, we searched the web for user reviews on various fast-passes, or express passes, for theme parks that integrated such a system.  We look for opinions on all scales - people that absolutely loved the system, and people that were absolutely disgusted by it.  This allowed us to get a sense as to what people liked about the system, and what people disliked about it.  With this information, we can weigh the pros-and-cons of how a theme park implements their system to come up with our own system that is able to maximize customer satisfaction while avoiding all the pitfalls that the implementers have fallen into.

The theme parks that implement some sort of fast-pass system are usually theme parks that are massive (Disneyland, Universal, etc).  This means that there are various sections of theme park and usually each section requires a different pass.  This creates some problems as it will create a giant hole in your wallet if you buy a pass for each section individually.

* Many of the implementations of fast-pass systems that we’ve found make it so that the regular queues are “shorter”, but it creates a new queue for the people with the fast-pass.  So, in essence, the regular queues become shorter, but effectively, the wait times become longer, because instead of one queue for an attraction, there is now two.  In addition, this new queue has priority seating because they have a fast-pass, extending the wait time of the people in the regular queue.
* Some other theme parks implement a time-based system, where the pass expires after a certain amount of time after the pass has been purchased.  By doing this, they are cutting down the cost on the pass, making it more affordable for the regular customer.

### Reflections on User Research

* __Interview__
  * Looking back at our interview it is obvious that we would have benefitted from a larger pool of interviewees.  Getting differing opinions from various different people is definitely ideal, especially if the setting is right (at a theme park), but given the circumstances that we are currently in, it is just not realistic.  If given the proper time, capitalizing on that would definitely be beneficial.
* __Survey__
  * Surveys are a great way to get opinions from a large group of people, however, we found that it is not always the size of the sample that counts, but also the target of that sample.  Since the survey was done over social media, anybody could do it, and that is both a good thing and a bad thing.  The good of it is that we can get opinions from a larger demographic, since the internet is accessible to a significant number of people.  However, the internet is usually a place to have fun, and people won’t always take what you say, or what you do, seriously.  This was the case we ran into when trying to distribute surveys over social media - joke answers.  A way to remedy this for future research is to scale down the target demographic, and get opinions from reliable people, rather than to everyone.  We could also put a disclaimer that we want only serious inquiries only, however this isn’t always helpful, due to how cynical people are on the internet.
* __Secondary Research__
  * Due to how vast the scope of the internet is, there is a lot of information to be found on there.  In our research, we were able to find information about various different theme parks and how they implemented their own “fast-pass” systems.  There is one problem that we’ve realized after the fact and that is that once you find what you’re looking for on the web, that is the end of it.  In future research, we would like to expand the scope of our search and along with searching with what we’re looking for, search for supporting information as well.  In our case, comparing costs of the different passes would be something useful to draw on, because the cost of the passes will affect what the customer thinks of the product immensely.

## Task Descriptions

1. Task: User is a ride junkie and wants to go to all rides with the lowest wait time
  * Lawrence is a 19 year old student attending the park grounds for the first time. He is a ride lover and wants to experience every ride that the park has to offer but has limited time.  In order to maximize his enjoyment at the theme park, he wants to go on all the rides and see all the attractions that end relatively quickly.  He plans to jump from one attraction to another, in sequence, not wasting a second of his time doing anything else.
2. Task: User wants to find an attraction that is suitable for their entire family
  * Karen and her husband Hubert of 5 years have 4 year old twin girls, Jill and Jane. Upon arriving to the theme park grounds, her two twins are immediately restless and are itching to go on a ride. Karen finds a suitable ride that her entire family can enjoy together, but it is on the other side of the park.  On the way to their destination, they take their time enjoying the scenery, and eating some of the food offered at the park.  Once they reach their destination, they enjoy the ride to its fullest, with Jill and Jane screaming out of happiness.
3. Task: User has a physical disability and wants to queue up for the all the closest rides
  * Arthur was recently involved in a car accident, so he must now get around using a wheelchair.  His friends came up with the idea to bring him to a theme park in order to cheer him up.  They enter the park grounds but Arthur becomes easily fatigue, not used to traveling in a wheelchair.  Arthur’s friends decide that they should only go to see the attractions that Arthur is capable of seeing, with close proximity being the key.  At the end of the day, Arthur is completely satisfied with the trip, and is glad to have such caring friends by his side.
4. Task: User is not interested in riding but is responsible for another person that wants to ride
  * Abigail and her husband, Timothy, are parents to a 6 year old son, Brian. Both Abigail and Timothy are not interested in rides in the least but want their child to experience the theme park to its fullest. Abigail lets her son choose a ride that he likes and they proceed to go to the location it resides in.  As Brian enters into the ride grounds, Abigail gets Timothy to supervise Brian as she leaves to get water for the family. Abigail comes back just in time to see Brian leave the ride grounds and gives him some water to drink.  Brian enjoyed the ride and wants to ride it again!
5. Task: User wants to find their favourite ride
  * Charles is an adventurous 21 year old who has been to the theme park many times already. From his previous visits, he is already aware of what his favourite rides are. As soon as Charles enters the park grounds, he immediately proceeds to one of his favourite rides. He then does the same with all of his favorite rides. 
6. Task: User wants to add another member to their already established group
  * Xavier is an introverted 24 year old man, but one thing that gets him out of his shell is a good thrill.  He enjoys visits to the theme park because it is the only time he ever feels he can come out of his shell.  He usually goes alone, but this time, his lifetime best friend, Patricia, wants to tag along.  He arrives ahead of Patricia, so he decides to enjoy some of the rides by himself before she arrives.  When Patricia gets to the grounds, she gives Xavier a call and he runs over to the admissions booth in order to meet with her.  They eventually meet up and are able to enjoy the attractions at the theme park, together.
7. Task: User loses track of time while eating, so they quickly want to check when their next scheduled ride is
  * Douglas is a 25 year old man on a date with Tabatha, a 21 year old woman.  It is their first time together, so they decided to break the ice by going to somewhere fun: a theme park!  After a jam-packed schedule of rides, they decided to take a break from all the fun and grab a bite to eat.  Douglas really feels that they have great chemistry together, as they enjoy a nice conversation while they’re eating.  However, Douglas loses track of the time, and in a panic, quickly checks what ride they have lined up next.  Luckily for the couple, the ride is only around the corner, with a few minutes to spare, so they are able to enjoy the ride, as well as the rest of their day, together.
