# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

The idea we have come up with for our project is to create an application that makes the Fast-Pass systems that some theme parks have implemented more efficient, as well as more accessible.  With the goal to improve efficiency, we hope that the users make the most of their experience at the theme park, and inspire others who may not otherwise choose to purchase a fast-pass, consider it.

We expect that our users will use this application during their visit to a theme park, to view the attractions available, as well as schedule a visit to an attraction, skipping the need to queue up.  By doing this, they are saving time wasted standing in a line, and may use their time to do other activities in the theme park, such as eating or visiting other attractions.


## Stakeholders and Users

Our expected users are common theme park go-ers, whether they are families, thrill seekers, or young adults (students).  With these users, they are expected to at have access to a cellphone, or another means of accessing the application.  With this expectation, they are also expected to have at least some sort of knowledge of how to operate an electronic device.  Navigation through the application won’t be difficult, but people without prior experience with such technology will struggle with the use of the device.  With this basic knowledge, the user should easily be able to schedule their times at their desired attractions.

The list below depicts our expected shareholders - the people who are affected by the system in one way or another, but are not necessarily users of the system:

* __Management__ - the main distributor of the system, so they are impacted directly by how well the system is doing
* __Employees__ - mainly affects the employees who work at an attraction - they need to have access to the system in order to properly check who is scheduled their time for an attraction.  Also affects the people who deal with admissions, since they are they ones who distribute the fast-passes
* __Customers__ - regular customers who don’t have a fast-pass aren’t directly interacting with the system, but they’ll be affected in the sense that fast-pass holders will be bypassing them while they wait in a queue

## User Research Methods

The three research methods that we chose for our project are:

* __Interview__
  * We selected this method because we believe that user accounts are the most effective and useful in obtaining information about fast-passes, because we can get their first-hand experience.  This way, we can easily extract what the user likes/dislikes about the system.
* __Survey__
  * We selected this method specifically because of the fact that we can reach a large amount of people with ease.
* __Secondary Research__
  * We selected this method to find out more about the user experience at theme parks that have implemented a similar system to the fast-pass system.  This is useful information because it is information that the user spends time to articulate and divulge onto the internet to help others make their own choices on the fast-pass system.

### User Research Method 1: Interview

The way we went about it is this: we each tried to find someone that has previously bought a fast-pass for a theme park, asking friends, relatives and family.  Given the limited time that we have, it would be difficult to go to a theme park, especially one that has a fast-pass system implemented, so we settled for one interviewee who recently went to Disneyland in April, 2017.  This interview took place in a quiet section of the Computer Science Laboratory.

The questions we asked, as well as the responses from the interviewee, can be found below:

* Some background information of the interviewee:
  * 21 years old
  * Went to Disneyland in California, USA
  * Likes to go on an adventure, tries to maximize the value of the stay by spending as much time as possible at the park and tries to go to all of the attractions
* What do you think about the fast-pass system?
  * Feels that it will be “worth it” if the normal queues are long
* How does the fast-pass system affect your theme park experience?
  * Liked that you can get priority for attractions, resulting in shorter wait time, and is especially useful when the weather is hot and humid
* What are some of the drawbacks?
  * Not always useful
    * Pointless if line-ups are not long
* What other functions could be added that would benefit you?
  * Wait time for the rides
  * Map of the park
  * Information about the ride
  * Free express pass
  * Limited time - have to line up to get another one
* Which demographic do you think the fast-pass is most beneficial for?
  * Youth, teenagers, families and ride enthusiasts


### User Research Method 2: Survey

![](http://lorempixel.com/1200/300/ "Motivational image")

In order to conduct the survey, we used SurveyMonkey to create a survey of the 5 questions that we made in the tutorial. The survey was deployed by sharing a link on social media and we received 7 responses.

Many of the takers of the survey said that the passes are expensive, but can see the merit in buying it for those who can afford to.  The pass can be beneficial for families, people with children, disabled or elderly people who cannot stand in line for an extended period of time.  Also, some feel that it magnifies the class difference between the people who uses the pass vs. those who don’t.  People who stand in the regular queue find it annoying that others can bypass them in the queue with more money, and even then it still creates another queue, so they will still have to wait.

* Recommended features of the system: 
  * Some sort of loyalty system where they can get the pass for free
  * Notifications for which rides are most/least busy, popular
  * Wait times for attractions
  * The ability to favourite attractions for easier access
  * Coupons or deals for future fast-pass opportunities
  * Instead of a fast-pass, everyone has the ability to schedule their time at an attraction


### User Research Method 3: Secondary Research

In execution, we searched the web for user reviews on various fast-passes, or express passes, for theme parks that integrated such a system.  We look for opinions on all scales - people that absolutely loved the system, and people that were absolutely disgusted by it.  This allowed us to get a sense as to what people liked about the system, and what people disliked about it.  With this information, we can weigh the pros-and-cons of how a theme park implements their system to come up with our own system that is able to maximize customer satisfaction while avoiding all the pitfalls that the implementers have fallen into.

The theme parks that implement some sort of fast-pass system are usually theme parks that are massive (Disneyland, Universal, etc).  This means that there are various sections of theme park and usually each section requires a different pass.  This creates some problems as it will create a giant hole in your wallet if you buy a pass for each section individually.

* Many of the implementations of fast-pass systems that we’ve found make it so that the regular queues are “shorter”, but it creates a new queue for the people with the fast-pass.  So, in essence, the regular queues become shorter, but effectively, the wait times become longer, because instead of one queue for an attraction, there is now two.  In addition, this new queue has priority seating because they have a fast-pass, extending the wait time of the people in the regular queue.
* Some other theme parks implement a time-based system, where the pass expires after a certain amount of time after the pass has been purchased.  By doing this, they are cutting down the cost on the pass, making it more affordable for the regular customer.

### Reflections on User Research

* __Interview__
  * Looking back at our interview it is obvious that we would have benefitted from a larger pool of interviewees.  Getting differing opinions from various different people is definitely ideal, especially if the setting is right (at a theme park), but given the circumstances that we are currently in, it is just not realistic.  If given the proper time, capitalizing on that would definitely be beneficial.
* __Survey__
  * Surveys are a great way to get opinions from a large group of people, however, we found that it is not always the size of the sample that counts, but also the target of that sample.  Since the survey was done over social media, anybody could do it, and that is both a good thing and a bad thing.  The good of it is that we can get opinions from a larger demographic, since the internet is accessible to a significant number of people.  However, the internet is usually a place to have fun, and people won’t always take what you say, or what you do, seriously.  This was the case we ran into when trying to distribute surveys over social media - joke answers.  A way to remedy this for future research is to scale down the target demographic, and get opinions from reliable people, rather than to everyone.  We could also put a disclaimer that we want only serious inquiries only, however this isn’t always helpful, due to how cynical people are on the internet.
* __Secondary Research__
  * Due to how vast the scope of the internet is, there is a lot of information to be found on there.  In our research, we were able to find information about various different theme parks and how they implemented their own “fast-pass” systems.  There is one problem that we’ve realized after the fact and that is that once you find what you’re looking for on the web, that is the end of it.  In future research, we would like to expand the scope of our search and along with searching with what we’re looking for, search for supporting information as well.  In our case, comparing costs of the different passes would be something useful to draw on, because the cost of the passes will affect what the customer thinks of the product immensely.
